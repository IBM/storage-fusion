The hyper-converged solution provides bare metal worker nodes, GPU nodes, and high speed switches - everything that you need to host your Data and AI platform.  The automated installer deploys Red Hat OpenShift, enabling you to get up and running quickly.  High performance container native storage is pre-configured for running IBM Cloud Pak for Data, further simplifying the deployment.\n\n> With IBM Fusion HCI, you can get a POC of watsonx up and running in less than a week.\n\nIBM Fusion HCI is fully tested with both OpenShift and watsonx.\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Quick deployment\"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Deploy an enterprise-grade watsonx enivronment in your data center in less than a week.\"\n    >\n    <ActiveServer aria-label=\"Appliance\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Orchestrated install\"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Automated OpenShift installation removes overhead of provisioning.\"\n    >\n    <ProcessAutomation aria-label=\"Automation\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Proven architecture\"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"No need to design, build, test, and maintain a custom architecture for an on-prem deployment.\"\n     >\n     <Tools aria-label=\"Automation\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </SquareCard>\n</Row>\n\n## Enterprise-grade resiliency for watsonx\n\nIBM Fusion HCI is built with resiliency in mind.  The appliance features a fully redundant networking, and its container native storage protects against node or drive failures using erasure coding.  The watsonx configuration is protected using built in backup and recovery capabilities, enabling you to recover your watsonx deployment to another cluster in the event of a disaster.\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Clusters on demand\"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Host multiple clusters in a single appliance, provisioning clusters on demand.\"\n    >\n    <ActiveServer aria-label=\"Appliance\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Enterprise ready\"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Highly available storage and networking protect against hardware failures.

It’s able to accelerate watsonx.data queries by providing a high speed distributed cache based on IBM’s proven technology used for High Performance Computing.  As queries are run, intelligent caching quickly serves meta-data and data, cutting down on the queries going to object storage.\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nWatch the video\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n##### &nbsp;\n\n<iframe width=\"2452\" height=\"1158\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JijBTRyiw0I\" title=\"IBM Storage Fusion HCI System Overview\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"72e2d63adb9915ffb2b22f2f8cdfce05","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":216},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM Cloud Paks","description":"IBM Fusion provides resiliency for IBM Cloud Paks.","tabs":["Overview","Resources"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM Cloud Paks\ndescription: IBM Fusion provides resiliency for IBM Cloud Paks.\ntabs: [Overview, Resources]\n---\n\nimport { WatsonxAi, WatsonxData, WatsonxGovernance } from '@carbon/pictograms-react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIBM Fusion enables optimized Data and AI solutions and is built to provide enterprise ready deployments of IBM watsonx.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Get up and running quickly with Fusion HCI</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Enterprise-grade resiliency for watsonx</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Accelerating watsonx.data queries with Fusion</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nPut AI to work with Watsonx.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Create competitive advantage \"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Foundation models make it possible to fine tune AI to an enterprise’s unique data and domain knowledge with a specificity that was previously impossible.\"\n    >\n    <WatsonxAi aria-label=\"watsonx.ai\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Scale AI across your business \"\n    href=\"/\"\n    bodyText=\"Make use of all your data, wherever it resides.
