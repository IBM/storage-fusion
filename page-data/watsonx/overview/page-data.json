The hyper-converged solution provides bare metal worker nodes, GPU nodes, and high speed switches - everything that you need to host your Data and AI platform.  The automated installer deploys Red Hat OpenShift, enabling you to get up and running quickly.  High performance container native storage is pre-configured for running IBM Cloud Pak for Data, further simplifying the deployment.\n\n> With IBM Fusion HCI, you can get a POC of watsonx up and running in less than a week.\n\nIBM Fusion HCI is fully tested with OpenShift, IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and watsonx.\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Quick deployment\"\n    href=\"\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"Get up and running with a production-grade watsonx deployment in your data center in less than a week.\"\n    >\n    <ActiveServer aria-label=\"Appliance\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Proven architecture\"\n    href=\"\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"No need to design, build, test, and maintain a custom architecture for an on-prem deployment of watsonx.\"\n     >\n     <Build aria-label=\"Automation\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Built for purpose\"\n    href=\"\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"All of the compute, network, storage, and GPUs needed for running watsonx.\"\n     >\n     <GpuComputing aria-label=\"GPU\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </SquareCard>\n</Row>\n\n## Enterprise-grade resiliency for watsonx\n\nIBM Fusion HCI is built with resiliency in mind.  The appliance features a fully redundant networking, and its container native storage protects against node or drive failures using erasure coding.  The watsonx configuration is protected using built in backup and recovery capabilities, enabling you to recover your watsonx deployment to another cluster in the event of a disaster.\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Highly available\"\n    href=\"\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"A resilient storage architecture and redundant networking protect against hardware failures.\"\n    >\n    <HighlyAvailable aria-label=\"Highly available\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Orchestrated backup and recovery\"\n    href=\"\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"Built in orchestration for backing up watsonx and recovering it in another cluster.\"\n    >\n    <Workflows aria-label=\"Resiliency\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n</Row>\n\n## Accelerating watsonx.data queries with Fusion\n\nIBM Fusion HCI doesn’t just provide a platform for running watsonx.  It’s able to accelerate watsonx.data queries by providing a high speed distributed cache based on IBM’s proven technology used for High Performance Computing.  As queries are run, intelligent caching quickly serves meta-data and data, cutting down on the queries going to object storage.\n\n## Watch the video\n\n<iframe width=\"2452\" height=\"1158\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjxY9mZPJGE\" title=\"watsonx.data storage acceleration with IBM Fusion HCI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0e4ee62b451c9f492b1c2c9389091e2e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":179},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM watsonx","description":"IBM Fusion enables optimized Data and AI solutions and is built to provide enterprise ready deployments of IBM watsonx.","tabs":["Overview","Resources"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM watsonx\ndescription: IBM Fusion enables optimized Data and AI solutions and is built to provide enterprise ready deployments of IBM watsonx.\ntabs: [Overview, Resources]\n---\n\nimport { ActiveServer, Build, GpuComputing, HighlyAvailable, WatsonxAi, WatsonxData, WatsonxGovernance, Workflows } from '@carbon/pictograms-react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIBM Fusion enables optimized Data and AI solutions and is built to provide enterprise ready deployments of IBM watsonx.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Get up and running quickly with Fusion HCI</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Enterprise-grade resiliency for watsonx</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Accelerating watsonx.data queries with Fusion</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nPut AI to work with watsonx.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Create competitive advantage\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\"\n    bodyText=\"Foundation models make it possible to fine tune AI to an enterprise’s unique data and domain knowledge with a specificity that was previously impossible.
