You can use this cluster as the control plane for your private cloud platform.  This hub cluster orchestrates the creation of virtual machines and additional OpenShift clusters using the compute resources in the appliance.  Worker nodes for each cluster are created using OpenShift virtualization, allowing you to right-size the amount of CPU and memory used for the worker nodes.  The control plane for each cluster is hosted by the hub using Hosted Control Plane, eliminating the need to provision control nodes for each cluster.\n\nThe hub cluster also provides data services for each cluster you create.  A container native storage provider uses the appliance NVMe drives to provide highly available block, file, and object storage.  A backup provider orchestrates data protection for workloads running in each cluster, and can restore a workload in place or to an alternate cluster.\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Multi-cluster architecture](/images/multi-cluster.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row className=\"square-card-group\">\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Easy to deploy\"\n    actionIcon=\"launch\"\n    href=\"https://medium.com/@bjrandal.dev/deploying-an-enterprise-grade-bare-metal-openshift-cluster-in-less-than-a-week-ad17b5a307d0\"\n    bodyText=\"Deploying Fusion HCI in your data center gives you a fully functioning OpenShift cluster that acts as the control plane for your private cloud.\"\n    >\n    <PowerOn aria-label=\"Easy to deploy\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Easy to operate\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"Day 2 operations for the appliance - such as scaling up, scaling out, or upgrading firmware - are fully automated.\"\n    >\n    <ControlsFramework aria-label=\"Controls\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n\n  <SquareCard\n    title=\"Easy to scale\"\n    actionIcon=\"\"\n    bodyText=\"Add additional nodes or even entire racks as your private cloud grows.\"\n     >\n     <ExtendTheDataCenter aria-label=\"Scale out\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n  </SquareCard>\n</Row>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"db3e22414da0960a8a493b6a9b5d2514","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":122},"frontmatter":{"title":"Private cloud","description":"IBM Fusion HCI acts as a private cloud control plane for Red Hat OpenShift, enabling you to provision clusters and virtual machines on demand."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Private cloud\ndescription: IBM Fusion HCI acts as a private cloud control plane for Red Hat OpenShift, enabling you to provision clusters and virtual machines on demand.\n---\n\nimport { principlesSection } from '../../styles/Grid.module.scss';\nimport { CloudObjectStorage, CloudPlatform, Cluster, ControlsFramework, ExtendTheDataCenter, PowerOn, VirtualServer } from '@carbon/pictograms-react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe IBM Fusion HCI appliance provides a private cloud for all of your OpenShift workloads.
