This hotfix fixes the following Backup & Restore issues:

    1.  Removed the validation for label, if label more than 63 character label will be truncated for Velero Backup CR.(Issue: 59712)
    2.  Fix KeyError while accessing intrinsic variable APP.namespace.name during restore.(Issue: 60235)
    3.  Redis certificate expiration causes jobs to fail (Issue: 59690)
    4.  OADP datamover Pods get assigned to a node without the backup volumes when PV topology is a subset of the StorageClass topology with StorageClass field volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer (Issue: 62485)
    5.  Restore fails with error Backup inventory info not returned from application service for applicationId (#59191)
    6.  Unable to restore pre 2.9 backup with 2.10.* (61073)
    7.  Backup fails intermittently with error Hit exception during "group/rg" : argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable (61235, 62741))
    8.  Jobs taking long to go from CancelPending to Cancelled state (61518)
    9.  Alert triggered for old backup job completion (62403)
    10. Backup fails due to a timeout when deleting VolumeSnapshotContent (Issue: 64678)
    11. Change AWS S3 connections with OADP to use virtual host style urls instead of host path style by default for proxy compatibility. Proxy services may rely on the bucket in the url's subdomain for validation. Buckets with "." in their name will still default to path style for compatibility. S3 compatibles will continue to use path style urls. Path style format may be forced by adding "FORCEAWSPATHSTYLE" to .spec.transactionManager.testFlags in the DataProtectionAgent. (#68134)
