Usage:
------

Native tool support to perform consistent backup and restore of couchdb 
application is not available on container platforms. To facilitate this,
we are taking help of a sidecar container and a egress policy which can
be applied as below (before starting the backup) -

$ oc apply -f couchdb-backup-restore.yaml

$ oc apply -f couchbackuprestore.yaml

$ oc apply -f backuprestore-egress.yaml

$ oc expose pod/c-example-couchdbcluster-m-0 --port 5984

Note: Image used by couchbackuprestore.yaml is from the dockerfile present in
      /buid directory.
