Recipe Enhancement Available
----

If using MongoDB community edition and IBM SLS alongside Maximo, the prefered recipe is available at [suite](../suite/) directory. 
This is a recipe enhancement that will take care of protecting the 3 namespaces e.g. (mongoce, ibm-sls, core) with a single recipe. 

The recipe in this directory is also available to use but will require that MongoDB and IBM SLS namespaces to be backed up individually. 

Backup
----
For detailed information about IBM Fusion resources such as backup policy, recipes and backup storage location, please refer the [Backing up and restoring with IBM Fusion](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/masv-and-l/continuous-delivery?topic=suite-backing-up-restoring-storage-fusion#taskt_backing_up_and_restoring_with_ibm_fusion__steps__1) section in MAS documentation <br>

### Steps for Maximo SLS namespace backup
1. cd to `maximo/sls`
   
2. Run the prerequisite script, for more information, run with the `-h` option

    `./scripts/backup-pre-req.sh`
3. Apply local recipe (frcpe) generated by the backup-pre-req script

    `oc apply -f maximo-sls-backup-restore-local.yaml`

Note: Following steps needs to be made on Hub cluster

4. From Fusion Console, create backup policy (fbp) specifying the frequency for backups
5. From Fusion Console, associate the backup policy to the SLS application. 
6. Retrieve the Policy Assignment Name:

    `oc get fpa -n ibm-spectrum-fusion-ns -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name --no-headers`
7. Update policy assignments (fpa) with recipe name and namespace

    `oc -n ibm-spectrum-fusion-ns patch fpa <policy-assignment-name> --type merge -p '{"spec":{"recipe":{"name":"maximo-sls-backup-restore-recipe", "namespace":"ibm-spectrum-fusion-ns"}}}'`
    ```
    recipe:
        name: maximo-sls-backup-restore-recipe
        namespace: ibm-spectrum-fusion-ns
    ```

Restore
----

### Prerequisite:
**Required:** <br>
1. RH [cert-manager](https://ibm-mas.github.io/ansible-devops/roles/cert_manager/) <br>
2. Maximo [ibm-operator-catalog](https://ibm-mas.github.io/ansible-devops/roles/ibm_catalogs/) should also be installed in cluster <br>
3. Restore [MongoDB](../mongodb/README.md) Namespace <br>

**Optional:** <br>
4. [Grafana](https://ibm-mas.github.io/ansible-devops/roles/grafana/): You must install same version (v4 or v5) as in source cluster if you were previously using Grafana

### Steps for Maximo SLS namespace restore
1. Before restoring application run the prerequisite script:

    `./scripts/restore-pre-req.sh`
2. Start SLS namespace restore to same or alternate cluster. For detailed procedure on how to restore an application with IBM Fusion, please refer to detailed steps in [Restoring Maximo Application Suite with IBM Fusion](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/masv-and-l/continuous-delivery?topic=suite-backing-up-restoring-storage-fusion#restore_mas_w_fusion__title__1)
