                      The client IP check can be disabled in case a load balancer causes that the requests to GUI within same session are send by different IPs.

                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                  If false, a "DeviceVerifyFailed" or a "DeviceInUse" event is displayed if the device verification fails. Set skipVerify to true only if you know what you do.
